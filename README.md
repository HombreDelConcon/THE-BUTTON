For this project, the ESP32 module used was the DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1. Building the buttons is very simple and only requires:
  - ESP32 modules
  - momentary push button (normally open)
  - LEDs
  - 330 ohm resistors

Before uploading the code into the ESP32s, you'll have to go into the code and change the SSID and PW variables to your WiFi network name and password respectively. For the LEDs, they can be set up using any pin you want, just be sure to change the variables for the pins in the code which should be near the top of the program. You may also use any port you see fit.
